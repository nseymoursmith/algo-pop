The video opens on an interior. It is a house. We see an old man, remembering fondly.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, in a spaceship, driving badly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing an Elvis costume in a car.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, driving to Vegas quickly.

Then, LEAD starts to sing, moving to Omaha joyously.

The video ends in a trailer. LEAD is shown remembering fondly with the old man.
