The video opens on an exterior. It is a city. We see a gruesome zombie, roaring terrifyingly.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, in a costume, dancing amazingly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a t-shirt in a parking lot..

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, singing to Michael Jackson beautifully.

Then, LEAD turns around, searching for a drive-thru frantically.

The video ends in a graveyard. LEAD is shown dancing tentatively with a gruesome zombie.
