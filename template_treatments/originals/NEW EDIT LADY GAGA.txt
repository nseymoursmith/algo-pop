The video opens on an exterior. It is an army base. We see soldiers in black leather uniforms, marching boldly.

The scene then cuts to male dancers dancing energetically.

Then, LEAD is seen as the character Sally Bowles from Cabaret, dancing and simulating sex acts with men on a stage, surrounded by spotlights.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, dressed in a white hooded robe, reminiscent of Joan of Arc.

Then, Gaga and her dancers are shown dancing in their military uniforms.

The video ends in an empty room. LEAD is shown dressed as a nun, her face burning.
