The video opens on an exterior. It is New York. We see buildings and crowds walking anonymously.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, performing the song on a street. 

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a verst with no sleeves.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, playing a piano softly.

Then, LEAD puts on a pair of sunglasses.

The video ends on Times Square. LEAD is shown playing piano.
