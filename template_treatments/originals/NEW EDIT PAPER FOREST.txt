The video opens on an exterior. It is a forest. We see a mother and daughter holding hands tenderly.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, on a stage dancing dreamily. 

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a ballgown in a spotlight.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, walking through the trees gingerly.

Then, LEAD starts to dance, flying through the forest slowly.

The video ends in webcam footage. LEAD is shown walking away happily with the mother and daughter.
