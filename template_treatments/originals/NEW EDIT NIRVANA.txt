The video opens on an interior. It is Culver City. We see a pep rally, practicing diligently.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, on a cheerleader, cheering loudly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing an anarchist symbol in a locker room.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, dancing romantically with a janitor.

Then, LEAD destroys the set angrily, with the cheerleaders.

The video ends in a car. LEAD is shown waving sadly to the fairytale prince.
