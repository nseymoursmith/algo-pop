The video opens on an interior. It is a dressing room. We see Katy Perry in a blonde wig changing quietly. 

The scene then cuts to LEAD, walking up a dark hill. 

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a kimono in Candyland.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, holding hands with the king tenderly.

Then, LEAD enters a dream sequence, watching the scenery happily.

The video ends in space. LEAD is shown dancing on the moon joyfully with an astronaut.
