The video opens on an exterior. It is a sandy beach. We see Korean actors with umbrellas dancing chaotically.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, performing his signature horse-dance. 

Then, LEAD is seen wearing yoga clothes in a parking lot.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, waving happily at senior citizens.

Then, LEAD walks towards the camera, shouting ‘Gangnam Style’ angrily.

The video ends on a tennis court. LEAD is shown yelling angrily with the senior citizens.
