The video opens on an exterior. It is a roof. We see a rapper, rapping excellently.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, on a staircase, tumbling quickly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a backwards cap on an airplane.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, flying backwards.

Then, LEAD finds the rapper, running towards him.

The video ends in a TacoBell. LEAD is shown firing wildly at the sky.
