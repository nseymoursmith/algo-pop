The video opens on an exterior. It is a field. We see a piece of cloth, being lifted floatily.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, on a picnic table, spinning crazily.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a bunny suit on a chair.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, setting a table carefully.

Then, LEAD starts to throw food, dancing in a river expertly.

The video ends in a river. LEAD is shown floating away morbidly with the poisoned coffee.
