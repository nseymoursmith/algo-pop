The video opens on an interior. It is a photo frame. We see a boyfriend, crying dramatically.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, on a basketball court, singing kindly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a Wolverine suit, healing a dog.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, flying in a helicopter.

Then, LEAD lands in Manhattan quickly with her sick dog.

The video ends in an alleyway. LEAD is shown shedding a tear secretly with a photograph.
