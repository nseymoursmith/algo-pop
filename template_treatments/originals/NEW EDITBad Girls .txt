The video opens on an exterior. It is the desert. We see crumbled architecture and mysterious women covered from head to toe, with only their kohl-lined eyes flashing out. 

The scene cuts to LEAD. She is filing her nails nonchalantly, riding a see-through, glow-in-the-dark car.

Then, LEAD leads a crowd of women in a drag race. It's a dusty evening. 

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, deadpan.

Then, a rearing, galloping horse is pictured, being ridden alongside the cars. 

The video ends on a Persian Gulf landscape â€“ dusty, baked, semi-apocalpytic. LEAD is shown walking away.
