The video opens on an exterior. It is the Grand Canyon. We see Seth Rogan and Kanye West, hugging romantically.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, in a landscape, flying swiftly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a basketball jersey, holding James Franco.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, riding a motorbike.

Then, LEAD arrives in Wigan with James Franco.

The video ends in a dancehall. LEAD is shown offering a rose generously with two dancing ladies.
