The video opens on an exterior. It is a cable car. We see a ski slope, bustling busily.

The scene then cuts to LEAD, in a club scene, bickering loudly.

Then, LEAD is seen wearing a Tom Ford suit on a stage.

In the chorus, LEAD lip-synchs to the camera, kissing Jessica Biel emotionally. 

Then, LEAD jumps over the balcony nimbly with the extras.

The video ends in a television. LEAD is shown sitting on a chair distantly with Jessica Biel.
